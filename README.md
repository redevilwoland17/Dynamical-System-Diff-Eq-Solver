This notebook shows how to numerically solve some cases of the three body problem. Here's a brief summary of its contents:
- Introduction to the Three-body problem: The notebook provides background information on the historical context and significance of the problem, along with some mathematical concepts like Lagrange points.
- Differential Equations in Python: The notebook discusses how Python can be used to solve differential equations related to the problem.
- Restricted Three-Body Problem: This section includes explanations and code implementations related to the restricted version of the three-body problem, including a specific example involving the Earth-Moon system.
- Code and Visualizations: The notebook contains Python code using libraries such as numpy, scipy, and matplotlib to model the problem and visualize the results.

The notebook also includes figures and images to illustrate the concepts and results. This was a group coursework for the UCL NSCI0007 module.
